# what is Heap?
@ans: A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In computer science, heaps are often used to implement priority queues and are also commonly used in algorithms like the heap sort algorithm.

@There are two main types of heaps:
Max Heap: In a max heap, for any given node I, the value of I is greater than or equal to the values of its children. The maximum element is found at the root of the heap.
Min Heap: In a min heap, for any given node I, the value of I is less than or equal to the values of its children. The minimum element is found at the root of the heap.
